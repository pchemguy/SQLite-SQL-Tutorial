I created this project to organize my knowledge, which I acquire as I learn the [SQLite][] RDBMS. I have spent some time learning the library and its C-API while working on a separate project (the [SQLiteC for VBA][SQLiteCAdoReflectVBA] library). Here, I plan to discuss select practical SQL problems, which I encounter as I learn the engine, and the associated solutions. My long-term goal - the use of SQLite as a backend for managing personal and research information - determines the scope of the discussed problems to a certain extent.
